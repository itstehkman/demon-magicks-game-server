##Ulavachakara

###WTF did you just call me?
Ulavachakara is a simple multiplayer game played with others online.

The goal of the game is to defeat the evil soul-leeching demon, Ulavachakara.
You are part of a team of demon slayers on a mission to demolish Ulavachakara
from this cursed world so that you and your team  can finally be safe and 
go about bickering and doing whatever the hell you want, happily ever after.

###Gameplay
Both Ulavachakara and the Demon Slayers start off with 100 HP. You can fight
Ulavachakara alone, or with other players online who connect to your game. 

You can select one of 4 moves, and each move has a cooldown which depends on
how many players are in the game. When a move is ready to be used, it will have
an (r) next to it. These are the moves: 

[1] Musashi's Endless Fury         
[2] Lu Bu's Skullpierce Arrow      
[3] Kvothe's Chandrian Magicks     
[4] Divine Shield Mask             

1 is a warrior move, 2 is an archer move, 3 is a mage move, and 4 is a shield.

Ulavachakara can be resistant to any move types at any time, and that is indicated 
above his icon. For example, if it says [W/A resistant] ontop of Ulavachakara,
that means he is resistant to warrior and mage attacks at that time.

Ulavachakara has a dragon breath attack, which he will shoot periodically. If your
team angers Ulavachakara by using the wrong attack at the wrong time, his dragon
breath will fire more often and with more power.

Note that this game is not turn-based, and all the players connected to the game
can try and use their attacks up whenever they want. The dynamic cooldown time
is what stops players from just constantly spamming attacks.

The shield spell has a very long cooldown, but if timed correctly, it will shield
you from Ulavachakara's dragon breath, mitigating most of the damage that would 
have been dealt otherwise.
